* How does it work?
It uses selenium, selenium can automate web browsers and this project uses it to get the youtube subscriptions because it is a list, which needs javascript to get loaded ('infinity pages').

Answer: Because google does not allow to log into your account with selenium directly through googles 'sign up' site.
