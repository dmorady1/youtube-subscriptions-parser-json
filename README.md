## Log into google manually

1.  start the program by
    
        python youtube-json-parse.py
2.  Go to <https://medium.com/> , why medium not Google? see [FAQ](#org59429c4)
3.  Click on Sign In
4.  Sign In with Google

Even if the message `"Sorry, we didnâ€™t recognize that account."` comes,
you are logged in.
Quick Check: If you can see your icon next to the url bar, then you are logged in


<table><tr>
<td><img src="./pictures/1.png" alt="not logged in" width="250"/></td>
<td><img src="./pictures/2.png" alt="logged in" width="250"/></td>
</tr></table>


5. Press Enter, program takes care of the rest

6. After the programs finish, you can exit the virtual environment by typing:


    ```exit```

7. A file `subscriptions.json` was created which can be used on [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe)

# Requirements

Only python3 is required

Works on GNU/Linux but it should work on Mac and Windows as well.

# How does it work?

It uses selenium, selenium can automate web browsers and this project uses it to get the youtube subscriptions because it is a list, which needs javascript to get loaded (&rsquo;infinity pages&rsquo;).

It calls the [https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels?app=desktop](https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels?app=desktop)
site, scrolls down to get all subscriptions. Scrape the website and creates the json file which can imported to [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe)

# FAQ


<a id="org985e7f2"></a>

## Why do I need to sign into google over `medium.com` ?

Answer: Because google does not allow to log into your account with selenium directly through googles &rsquo;sign up&rsquo; site.



<a id="org99"></a>

## Why do I need to log in manually?
Answer: Because I **don't** want to store your password in a variable. It could
feel less secure and vulnerable. I considered to use a `--lazy` option but before
I receive any complaints, I dropped it. So the only option is to log into google
on your own, through medium.
